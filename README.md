# vita_app

A new Flutter project.


The project name of the application is vita_app. 
It is the third version of the application, which is currently in the early stages of development. 
The application aims to calculate the nutritional values in meals. 
I use the FoodData Central database from USDA to store data. Initially, I planned to use an API to retrieve data, but I  decided to use a JSON file instead, which allows for immediate access to data without delays. 
I utilize Isar Database as the local database. 
I also strive to adhere to the principle of clean architecture. 
The general outline of the application is as follows: users select favorite ingredients from the list of ingredients available in FDC, which includes over 5000 items. Then, based on the consumed favorite ingredients, the application generates a list of meals containing information about the nutritional content of each meal. 
The application aims to increase awareness of the actual nutritional values consumed. 
Additionally, in the future, I plan to expand the functionality of the application to include the ability to calculate the price of a particular meal based on prices from local stores or a general database.
